prophase 1 metaphase 1 anaphase 1 and telophase 1 similarly meiosis II is divided into four phases prophase 2. metaphase 2 anaphase 2 And telophase 2.Meiosis 1 results in 2 haploid daughter cells due to the separation of the homologous chromosomes in the parent cell.meiosis 2 follows meiosis 1 and results in 4 haploid cells meiosis 2 resembles mitosis has the same number of chromosomes is retained in the daughter cells between the two.Prophase 2 is followed by metaphase 2 during this phase.The next phase of meiosis II is anaphase 2 early anaphase the centromere of each chromosome divide into two and splits the chromosome in the daughter chromosomes.These daughter chromosomes are then pulled to the opposite poles of the cell during the late anaphase stage.Telophase 2 is generally followed by cytokinesis during which the cytoplasm in each cell is equally divided.Meiosis trees of life and Road in sexually reproducing organisms.
